### **Aspect Based AI Analysis of iPhone Customer Reviews (Python)**
This project dives deep into customer feedback for the Apple iPhone 11, going beyond simple star ratings using **Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA)**
*  **Data Loading & Exploration üîç** We're starting by loading the data and getting to know it, looking for patterns and insights.
*  **Text Preprocessing üßπ** We're cleaning up the review text by making everything lowercase, removing punctuation and numbers, and using spaCy to lemmatize words and remove stop words.
*  **Aspect Extraction üéØ** We're finding the key features people talk about using frequency analysis (CountVectorizer) and matching them against a list of relevant iPhone features.
*  **Sentiment Assignment üòÉüòû** We're using NLTK's VADER sentiment analyzer to figure out the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) for each aspect in the sentences where they appear.
*  **Analysis & Visualization üìà** Finally, we're summarizing and visualizing the sentiments to see what people really think about each aspect.
