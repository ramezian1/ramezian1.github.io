### About Me

My name is Robert Mezian, and I'm a dedicated and enthusiastic coder with a keen interest in web development and data structures using Python and Java. I enjoy tackling challenging problems and creating innovative solutions through code. Python Automation and Java object orientations are a few of my favorite projects to work on.
