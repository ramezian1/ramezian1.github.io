# Welcome to My Coding Portfolio üëã
By Robert Mezian

This repository showcases a collection of my coding projects, combining my various projects from multiple repositories into one simple and easy web layout. This page demonstrates my skills and passion for software development, as well as my expertise and knowledge with languages such as Java, Python, HTML/CSS, and Javascript. All code is done by me alone over a various period of time! Some for fun, others for work and/or school. 

## About Me

My name is Robert Mezian, and I'm a dedicated and enthusiastic coder with a keen interest in web development and data structures using Python and Java. I enjoy tackling challenging problems and creating innovative solutions through code. Python Automation and Java object orientations are a few of my favorite projects to work on. With over 3 years of experience, I have managed to code various programs for different tasks to create something new and efficient for programming. I've worked for various companies as well such as Amazon Web Services, and NBCUniversal. Feel free to look at my experience and skills [on my resume here](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18246255/Resume.New.2024.pdf) as well as view my previous projects on my Github profile and website [here!](https://ramezian1.github.io)

## üìí Projects

Here are just a few of my featured projects:

### **Java Spring Boot Web Application: Finance Tracker**
A Java-based back end web application I developed and designed to help users manage and organize their tasks efficiently. With features that allow for task creation, editing, deletion, and categorization, this tool aims to streamline task management for individuals and teams alike. Built using Java for backend with Spring Boot, and Javascript alongside HTML and CSS, the application provides a simple yet effective way to keep track of tasks, set deadlines, and prioritize work. [Here's a link to this project](https://github.com/ramezian1/finance-tracker).
   
### **HTML/Javascript - Web Design**
A dynamic website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, showcasing interactive elements, responsive design, and modern web development techniques. 
[Here's a link to this project!](html/index.html).

  
### **Python - Automated Checkout Bot:**
A Python script that automates tasks, such as web scraping, data processing, or system administration, using libraries like Selenium or Beautiful Soup. 
You can view the code or clone it via git under the python/test folder. [Here's a link to this project!](https://github.com/ramezian1/ramezian1.github.io/tree/main/python).
