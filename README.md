You can view the code or clone it via git under the python/test folder. **[Project Link](https://github.com/ramezian1/ramezian1.github.io/blob/main/python/main.py)**


### **Python - Encrypted Password Manager**
This Python-based password manager helps users securely save, store, and encrypt passwords. The application uses Fernet encryption to ensure that your passwords are protected. The following features are:
1. Add Password: Securely store a password for a specific username.
2. Check Password: Verify if a given password matches the stored encrypted password.
3. Find Password: Retrieve the encrypted password for a given username.
4. Delete Password: Remove a stored password for a given username.
5. Master Password: Requires entering a master password to authenticate and access the password manager.
