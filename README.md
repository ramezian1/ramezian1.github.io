### About Me

My name is Robert Mezian, and I'm a dedicated and enthusiastic coder with a keen interest in web development and data structures using Python and Java. I enjoy tackling challenging problems and creating innovative solutions through code. Python Automation and Java object orientations are a few of my favorite projects to work on. With over 3 years of experience, I have managed to code various programs for different tasks to create something new and efficient for programming. I've worked for various companies as well such as Amazon Web Services, and NBCUniversal.
