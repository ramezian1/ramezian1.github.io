## Welcome to Robert Mezian's Coding Project's! 👋

This repository showcases a collection of my coding projects, combining my various projects from multiple repositories into one simple and easy web layout. This page demonstrates my skills and passion for software development, as well as my expertise and knowledge with languages such as Java, Python, HTML/CSS, and Javascript. All code is done by me alone over a various period of time! Some for fun, others for work and/or school. 

### About Me

My name is Robert Mezian, and I'm a dedicated and enthusiastic coder with a keen interest in web development and data structures using Python and Java. I enjoy tackling challenging problems and creating innovative solutions through code. Python Automation and Java object orientations are a few of my favorite projects to work on. With over 3 years of experience, I have managed to code various programs for different tasks to create something new and efficient for programming. I've worked for various companies as well such as Amazon Web Services, and NBCUniversal. Feel free to look at my experience and skills on [my resume here](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17630384/2024_ResumeRobertMezian.pdf) as well as view my previous projects done down below!


## 📒 Projects 

Here are some of my featured projects:

 ### **Java Spring Boot Web Application: Finance Tracker**
A Java-based back end web application I developed and designed to help users manage and organize their tasks efficiently. With features that allow for task creation, editing, deletion, and categorization, this tool aims to streamline task management for individuals and teams alike. Built using Java for backend with Spring Boot, and Javascript alongside HTML and CSS, the application provides a simple yet effective way to keep track of tasks, set deadlines, and prioritize work.
